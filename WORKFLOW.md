DevOps Git Workflow Project
A practical implementation of version control best practices
 Core Components:

Branching strategy with main, dev, and feature branches

Real pull request examples

Version tagging for releases
.gitignore       # Filters out unnecessary files
script.sh        # Sample deployment script

## Git Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/login`
2. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "message"`
3. Push: `git push -u origin feature/login`

1. Setting Up the Foundation
Initialized the repo with git init

created three core branches:
bash
git branch main
git branch dev
git branch feature/login


2. Made atomic commits with clear messages

bash
git add .
git commit -m "  "

3. Release Process
Merged approved features into dev

Promoted stable builds to main

Tagged milestones:

bash
git tag -a v1.1 -m "Production release Jan 2024"
